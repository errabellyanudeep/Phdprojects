## (To Foercast seizures  at least 10 seconds in advance /2 time windows)


1)What Dataset contain:  EEG recordings of Neonatal subjects just born)

2)Dataset Downlaod Source:  https://zenodo.org/records/2547147

3)I have everything setup in .ipynb file, where it ingests data from dropbox, Automatically it woild create Folders and trains using "TCN (Temporal Convolutional Neural Network)" with class weighting  to eliminate , class imbalance problem between 0(Non-Seizure) and 1(Seizures)

4)I must admit that, it might be  helpful for Neuro-Science Enthusiasts, i Honestly admit, this was an initial committ, will improve as time professes by and please let me know your suggestions and advices


Note: I am open to listen to my mistakes, suggestions from fellow  researchers and faculty member/ Industry people too. I would be ore than happy to colloborate with people who work with  Neurosceince across the world.  Reach me @ https://www.anudeeperrabelly.com
