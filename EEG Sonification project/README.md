# EEG Sonification

## (Process of converting EEG signals into sound form to hear them , just as how you hear the Heart beats.)



1)What Dataset contain:  EEG recordings of subjects before and during the performance of mental arithmetic tasks (Serial subtraction of two numbers)  e.g. (3141 - 42).

2)Dataset Downlaod Source:  physionet.org/content/eegmat/1.0.0/ 

3)After tunning the file named EEG_sonification.ipynb  present inside the folder EEG Sonification project ,  listen to beta activity waves both before  and after inducing external mental stress , by asking  subejct to be in resting state and perform serial substractions (meaning more than mone in a minute) for ex: like (3132-34) like this.

4)If possible, also onserve the Topographic plots, which to be honest , i might not have done, but it wil be a great way to visualize  power distributions on the scalp  of subjects
